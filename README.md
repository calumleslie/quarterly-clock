# Quarterly

"What Quarter is it?", and "How long do we have left?", visualised as a clock.

# Credits

The original idea for this came from [Brett Bunting][brett] back in August 2021. Further development and feedback came from the ðŸš€ Hyperdrive team at Skyscanner, [Stuart Paton][stuart] in particular.

To some extent, [I](https://www.houseofmoran.com/) ignored [Brett's][brett] subsequent wishes, so I shall give him credit for all the positives, and I'll take any negatives ðŸ˜Š.
